    "- Syscall\n",
    "    - they are an architecture-specific way for your program to ask the OS to do something priviledged\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Think of the OS as a gatekeeper to priviledged operations that only the kernel can do\n",
    "    -implicit vs explicit syscalls:\n",
    "        - many syscalls are required to run any executable, even if it doesn't make any calls of its own(implicit)\n",
    "            - ex. your shell and OS have to make syscalls to load, run, and exit a program\n",
    "            - gcc include libc startup/teardown code\n",
    "            - you can explicitly invoke syscalls to operate in kernelspace from your program\n",
    "    - When looking into and tracking explicit calls use the syscall() function from libc\n",
    "        - ex. pidt pid = syscall(SYS_getpid); where pid = process id\n",
    "- how do I know what all the syscalls available on my system are?\n",
    "    - you can run the \"ausyscall --dump\" audit syscall function to return all syscalls available to you in the given context\n",
    "        - running this will give you ~460 syscalls and their associated syscall id ex. 172 = getpid (get process id)\n",
    "        - if you run: ausyscall --dump | grep getpid  => 172 getpid\n",
    "    - you can also look at C header files\n",
    "- man7.org has linux documentation for syscalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### switching from user to kernel space (\"context swithcing\") occurs every syscall\n",
    "- the userspace of your CPU contains the \"state of your program including stack & registers\" -->> and it gets saved to a \"process-specific kernel stack\" -hydrates state->> to of kernel stack and makes syscall executions neccessary against the CPU in \"kernelspace\" \n",
    "    - and this process is reversed in order to refresh the state of the userspace after the syscall!\n",
    "- Context switching is \"Expensive\"! in terms of time 1,000,000 context switches is equivalent to 0.8seconds\n",
    "    - only use syscalls when required, use libraires that avoid syscalls, batch syscalls where possible (\"buffers\")\n",
    "- passing args to syscalls from C\n",
    "    - they may take simple types like a \"long\"\n",
    "    - other times you may have to pass C structs/ that deal with \"struct alignement\"\n",

    "    - **An array name evaluates to be a pointer to the first element**\n",
    "    - so getting the address of a == &(a[0]), where address of set a is equivalent to the memory location of the first index of the array.\n",
    "        - &() (ampersands) gives the address of the element within its parentheses\n",
    "    - In that same respect a[0] == \\*a where: (* = the contents of or known as the dereferencing operator) *of and address is the contents of that address\n",
    "    - a[i] == *(a+i) for example if a[0]== 0xe014 then a[3]==0xe017\n",
    "    - in a[2]; the a is the pointer to the first memory location of the array and the 2 moves along 2 memory slots.\n",
    "    - pointers are the way we calculate where something in memory is.\n",
    "    - the only thing you do with pointers is:\n",
    "        - one: add pointers and integers\n",
    "        - two: subtract pointers from eachother\n",
