    "- Network protocols are a set of rules that govern how data is formatted, sent, and recieved between devices on a computer network.\n",
    "    - the most widely used network protocol is TCP/IP\n",
    "- Network Protocols can be stateful or stateless\n",
    "    - Statless: each conncection between sender and reciever is only alive to send that one message and receive a response => for each exhange a new connection is made\n",
    "        - stateless protocols will be faster, will have less overhead but will not be fully reliable\n",
    "    - Statefull protocol maintains a connection between a sender and a reciever for the duration of a process and allowing both the receiver and sender to **maintain a protocol \"state\" to keep track of an exchange \"context\"**\n",
    "        - statefull protocols will have more robust capabilities such as reliability but will be slower with more overhead\n",
    "    - most application protcols will be statefull whereas most lower-level network protocols tend to be stateless(with the exception of TCP)\n",
    "- OSI model(network model) - abstract way to define a network stack in 7 layers\n",
    "    - layers: 1 physical(computer network card)-> 2 Data Link -> 3 Network(Ip addresses) -> 4 Transport -> 5 Session -> 6 Presentation -> 7 Application\n",
    "    - if not concerned with physical components, layers 1-4 can all be considered transport\n",
    "    - layers 5-7 can be thought of as the DATA which is a combination of segmenets made up of data packets.\n",
    "    - layers 5/6 are very abstract no strong purpose.\n",
    "    - segments(in transport layer) have packets, packets have frames, frames have bits\n",
    "- TCP/IP Network Model(widely used) - concrete implementation of a network stack\n",
    "    - 5 layers: 1 physical(computer network card)-> 2 Data Link -> 3 Network(Ip addresses) -> 4 Transport -> 7 Application(5,6 contents covered in this layer (application layer))\n",
    "    - TCP is \"FULL-Duplex\" meaning through one TCP connection you can send and recieve messages at the same time (2 threads)\n",
    "    - TCP is STREAM protocol(a stream of bytes flow) -NOT a individual messages(not message based)\n",
    "        - this means you need to build into your application where messages begin and end (define a endpoint of the stream to the reciever.\"EOF\")\n",
    "- UDP is a message based protocol(2nd most popular approach) individual messages are packaged and delivered - Not very reliable given that messages can get lost and you would never know that you missed a message (not guarunteed to be recieved).\n",
    "- getting data across a network:\n",
    "    - establish a transport link between browser and an application(transport layer #4)(holds level 7 traffic) (uses Port numbers to locate the application  on individual nodes)\n",
    "    - establish a network link between source node on your computer to a server node supporting the application(layer 3)(IP Adresses - locating Nodes on a broader network)\n",
    "    - establish frame links that move data from the source node to a router then to the cloud and then to another router and then to the pyhsical server node supporting the application.(layer1/layer2)(MAC Addresses - traversing next \"Hop\")\n",
    "- to get data across a network you need a destination address and a senders address(level 4) lower levels(1-3) are concerned with how it gets to that destination address.\n",
    "    - key addresses:\n",
    "        1- mac address -  unique machine identifier used to send mail(data) hop-to-hop from sender to recivever (intermediate destinations(routers))\n",
    "        2- IP address - 32 bit number to represent a device on a particular network (an represent an API endpoint). ex.10.50.47.88\n",
    "        3- port address - 32 bit number used to represent an application on a specific device ex. Port 443(https default port) & Port 80(http default port)\n",
    "- Sockets\n",
    "    - **Sockets are the programming interface provided by the operating system enabling applications to write network programs**\n",
    "        - syscalls are made to sockets to utilize a network connection.\n",
    "    - Sockets sit inbetween application layer(7)(what users interface with) and trasnport/network/datalink layers(4-2 - implemented by the operating system) in the network Stack\n",
    "    - Sockets provide a \"file\" abstraction over making network connections\n",
    "    - socket syscall in C: - creating a TCP socket in C\n",
    "        - listen_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)\n",
    "        - where AF_INET is the domain - IPv4 vs. IPv6\n",
    "        - where SOCK_STREAM - is the type, streaming protocol or data varing(UDP)\n",
    "        - where 0 is the protocol - 0 is the default TCP protocol\n",
    "        - acts as a file descriptor (integer_id of the file descriptor)\n",
    "    - \"setsockopt()\" is a method used to set up socket options for a TCP socket\n",
    "    - when binding a server to an address that means we are \"listening\" on it\n",
    "        - components of an address: family, address, port\n",
    "            - ex. addr.sin_family = AF_INET\n",
    "                  addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY)\n",
    "                  addr.sin_port = htons(PORT_NUM)\n",
    "        - 10.10.10.10:1234 is (IPV4):(port) is a representation as \"address\"\n",
    "        - \"htonl()\" is a method host to network long will take into consideration your endianess and architecture of your system to make sure it configures the address correctly\n",
    "    - listening 0.0.0.0 means listen on any available network interfaces\n",
    "    - need to use \"bind()\" to bind a client to a server and their can only be one server connected to a client at a time\n",
    "        - need to re-use this boiler plate code for assignment.\n",
    "    - when you activate it by listen() you can use process_requests()(the functionality of other assignments.) and then close() the TCP socket\n",
    "    - using the \"accept()\" method on a socket will lock it for use\n",
    "    - use \"recv()\" to get the data of the message"
