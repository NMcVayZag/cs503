    "- C is procedural and doesn't support object oriented functionality\n",
    "- In C you cannot simply change the data type of a variable\n",
    "- In C a float is a number with 6 possible decimals while a double is a number with 15 possible decimal points \n",
    "    - (doubles run faster but take up more memory 8bytes vs 4 bytes)\n",
    "    - interestingly the compiler is rounding your figures either way so **whenever accuracy of the figure is important doubles are used**\n",
    "- When inserting a variable into a formatted string, the insertion symbol is dependent on the data type of the variable you're inserting \n",
    "    * if you are inserting a int => %d or %i\n",
    "    * if you are inserting a double or float => %f\n",
    "    * if you are inserting a char => %c\n",
    "\n",
    "    ex. where rate = 15.24; printf(\"My interest rate on my credit card isn't so bad, its only %f%\", rate)\n",
    "- if you want a variable to be immutable you can specify it as a constant during declaration like so:\n",
    "    - const int DAYSINWEEK = 7; (it is best practice to declare constants in all caps)\n",
